## ⚔️ Special Weapon Tips
*   **Heavies (Mace/Axe):** Very high damage but slow swings. Time your hits carefully!
*   **Speedsters (Nunchaku/Knuckles):** Very fast attacks. Stay close to the enemy and keep hitting them.
*   **Polearms (Spear):** Use the long reach to hit enemies before they can get close to you.
*   **Throwables:** If an enemy is running away, press **Space** or the **Throw button**. The weapon will fly, hit them, and magnetically return to your hand!
